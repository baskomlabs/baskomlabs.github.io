# BaskomLabs Website & QRSTU Landing Page

This is the official website for **BaskomLabs** and the landing page for the **QRSTU** app.

## Structure
- `index.html`: The main Single Page Application (SPA).
- `style.css`: Contains both the "Retro" (Baskom) and "Modern" (QRSTU) styles.
- `script.js`: Handles the SPA navigation, animations, and the portal transition.

## Features
- **Retro Identity:** CRT scanlines, glitch effects, and 8-bit typography for BaskomLabs.
- **Modern Portal:** A "Hyper-Jump" transition to the sleek, dark-mode QRSTU landing page.
- **SPA:** Seamless navigation without page reloads.
- **Privacy Policy:** Integrated directly into the app interface.

## How to Run
Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No build step required.
