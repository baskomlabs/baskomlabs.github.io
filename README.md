## 📱 Flagship Product: QRSTU

**Decode the Code. Rank Up the Mode.**

**QRSTU** stands for **QRIS Reader, Scoring, & Tracking Utility**.
It is not just a scanner; it is a tool designed to demystify the transactions you make every day while adding a layer of gamification to your digital spending.

### Core Features

*   **🕵️ Decode (Advanced Parser):**
    Don't just pay blindly. QRSTU parses raw QRIS data, revealing the Merchant ID, Criteria, and other hidden details behind those pixelated squares.

*   **🏆 Rank Up (Gamification):**
    Turn every transaction into an achievement. Earn XP for every unique scan and climb the ladder from a **Newbie** to a **QRIS God**.

*   **📈 Track (Local History):**
    Your data belongs to you. We provide a smart tracking history that stores your scan logs locally on your device.
