We use **Firebase** (provided by Google) to improve our application stability and user experience:

* **Firebase Authentication** : To manage user sign-ins securely.
* **Firebase Crashlytics** : To collect anonymous crash reports and logs to help us fix bugs.
* **Firebase Firestore** : To sync your scan history across your devices.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

* **To Provide Features** : We use the camera to scan QR codes and display the parsed information to you.
* **To Improve Reliability** : We use crash logs to identify and fix app failures.
* **To Sync Data** : We use cloud storage to ensure your history/leaderboard data is available when you log in.

## 3. Data Retention and Deletion

* **Retention** : We retain your scan history and profile data as long as your account is active.
* **Deletion** : You may request the deletion of your account and associated data at any time by using the "Delete Account" or "Sign Out" features within the application, or by contacting us.
